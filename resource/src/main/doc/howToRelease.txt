mandatory steps to build a betterFORM release
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- change release number in build.properties.xml
- update release-notes.txt
- search and replace old version to new version number in web/src/main/webapp/download.html
- search and replace old version to new version number in tools/exist/betterform/build.xml (#15)
- update pom files by running ROOT-OF-WORKSPACE/build.xml target 'update-maven-poms'.
- to be certain run a global search for the old version number to reveal possible glitches
- commit the changed files
- tag the release with the new version number
  - use IntelliJ 'Version Control | Browse Subversion Repository'
  - goto https://betterform.de/svn/betterform
  - select trunk
  - context menu: 'Branch or Tag'
  - select tags
  - provide the new version tag, a commit message and confirm the dialog
- checkout the newly created tag from SVN

- open a shell to build distribution with Ant
  - ant root/build.xml clean-all
  - ant root/build.xml create-src-distribution (SHOULD HAPPEN HERE AS IT WILL DELETE ALL 'target' DIRS)
  - ant tools/installer/build.xml clean create-betterFormInstaller
  - ant core/build.xml distribute
  - ant web/build.xml distribute to build the src distribution
  - ant web/build.xml package to build the war file
- upload packs (betterform-*) to server :/srv/tomcat/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/packs
- upload betterform.zip (the eXist betterform extension!) to server :/srv/tomcat/tomcat/ROOT/dist
