                <p>Technology should help people in their everyday life and make it easier. The
                    applications we create for our customers in the eHealth &amp; eGovernment domain are examples
                    for this motivation.</p>

                <p>Open technologies and open industry standards guarantee the longevity
                    and
                    flexibility of our solutions. We always work close to our customers and
