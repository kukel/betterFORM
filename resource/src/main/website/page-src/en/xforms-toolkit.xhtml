                                    making it an ideal partner in SOA and EAI.

                                    The XForms Toolkit adds an abstraction layer to your web application development and lifts

                                    The descriptive and generic approach
                                    avoids repetitive scripting lowers the cost for development and changes.
                                    You get running applications within days.

                                    The betterFORM engine turns XForms into state-of-the-art Web 2.0 applications which can be
                                    consumed by every major desktop or mobile browser. With a rich set of styling options you
                                    can tailor the look&amp;feel to exactly match the guidelines
                                    of your CI.

                                    XForms-driven applications allow to very easily aggregate various data sources
                                    into one view and to act upon that data. A generic set of actions allows data- as well as
                                    user interface manipulation without writing a single line of script code.

                                    The validity of data is essential for serious applications. XForms adds fine-grained
                                    validations to your data and assists users in the data capture process with early
                                    feedback and
                                    fully dynamic user interface.
                                </p>

                                    XForms is declarative and even handles complex industry standards by generation of
                                    large sets
                                    of forms from XML Schema. Subforms can be embedded dynamically at runtime and help
                                    modularize big data-driven applications.
