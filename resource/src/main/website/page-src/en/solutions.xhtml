                        Ever dreamed of just using your XML-data without the hassle to use a mapping to store it inside a database? Are you using
                        established standards which provide their own XML-schema definitions like Health Level 7 or Aeronautical Information Exchange Model?
                        Want to create usable and clear user interfaces from schema definitions or even validate your data against these? Then betterFORM
                        is the right companion for the task at hand.

                        In advanced technology fields like EAI, SOA or EDI but not limited to these XML is the lingua franca of data exchange as it is easy to
                        produce and consume. This is the common ground on which heterogeneous systems can be coupled with each other
                        without needing to use proprietary interfaces. XML allows aggregation
                        and exchange of information between these systems.

                    Service-oriented architectures typically hide complex internal logic
                    behind a service-layer to be used as an outer facade to the system. SOAP messages
                    often play a major role in this area and are natively supported by XForms. This makes it an ideal
                    tool to build dynamic, validating browser front-ends that directly interact with your web services.
                    Additional validation layers are unnecessary as your forms always send valid data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    XForms applications can load as many data instances from different sources at once,
                    pulling them together in individual views for the user, allow to act upon the data
                    and send them back for storage or further processing by a service. XForms and other
                    open XML technologies together can enhance the functionality of existing systems with a mature form processing engine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Complete XML applications can address even more demanding requirements. Data collection, harvesting,
                    metadata management and messaging are just examples of the broad possibilities
                    of XML technology.
