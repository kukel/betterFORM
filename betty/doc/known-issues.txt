Known Issues
-----------------

1. The submission replace mode 'all' does not work currently with Convex.

The reason for this is that the applet actually does the submission and also gets the server response. In case of
a replace="all" this could be any kind of document on an arbitrary mimetype. The problem for the applet is to put
back this response into the browser and still show the right location. Normally the applet (unless it's signed)
the applet only has restricted access to its browser it's contained in.

While there might be ways to pass the response content to the browser somehow we currently do not see a solution
for maintaining the right Url (from where the response originated) in the locationbar of the browser.

Workaround:
Do not use submission replace="all" ;)

Instead always a submission replace="none" and a following 'load' action will do the same job for your form. E.g.

<xf:trigger>
  <xf:label>submit</xf:label>
  <xf:action>
    <xf:send submission="non-replacing-submission"/>
    <xf:load resource="new-Url-to-show" />
  </xf:action>
</xf:trigger>


2. Deployment on file system
When running forms directly from the file system, the forms must be higher in the directory tree than the
dir 'resources'. The reason for this is that Dojo cannot load files that are higher in the hierarchy. It uses xhr
to load files that are pulled in with dojo.require and the browser security model does not allow that. This can
potentially circumvented by using a dojo build as this already has all resources inlined and therefore does not
need to use dojo.require. But once a not-included resource will be needed this has to be included into the build AND
there might be some areas where dojo still uses dynamic loading.

However these restrictions does not apply to a deployment on the server (applet loaded via http).

The current default deployment is to put the files into a directory above the resources to avoid the problem though is
is not ideal from an directory layout point of view. Later on we may have an option to explicitly open a file from
the applet which may take away the problem.
